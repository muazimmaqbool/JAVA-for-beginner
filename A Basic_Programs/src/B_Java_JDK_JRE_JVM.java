/* What is JDK?
JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit required to develop applications in Java.
 When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.
In addition to JRE, JDK also contains a number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger, etc).
*/
/* What is JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.
When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. 
Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's 
CPU executes directly). 
*/
/* What is JRE?
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides Java class libraries, 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
and other components that are required to run Java applications.
JRE is the superset of JVM.
