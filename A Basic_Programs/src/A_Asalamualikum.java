// basic java program
/*Java is a platform-independent language. 
 It's because when you write Java code, 
it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine (computer). 
Since JVM â€‹executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent.*/

// Inventor of java programming language : James Gosling
/* Java is a case-sensitive programming language, like C++. 
 * Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure. Java is a class-based programming language.
 * java technology is used for developing both, applets and applications.*/
public class A_Asalamualikum {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		
		System.out.println("Asalamualikum");	
	}    
}

// Points to remember:
// name of the class should match the filename in Java.

/* public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
 *  This is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. 
  The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method. */

/* System.out.println("Hello, World!");
The code above is a print statement. It prints the text Hello, World! to standard output (your screen).
 The text inside the quotation marks is called String in Java.
