//Java Methods
//A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.
public class C_Methods {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	      //Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.
		/*In Java, there are two types of methods:
		User-defined Methods: We can create our own method based on our requirements.
		Standard Library Methods: These are built-in methods in Java that are available to use.*/
		//Declaring a Java Method
		/*returnType methodName() {
  		// method body
			}*/
		//This is the simple syntax of declaring a method. However, the complete syntax of declaring a method is
          //modifier static returnType nameOfMethod (parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
		  // method body
		//}
		/*Here,
		modifier - It defines access types whether the method is public, private, and so on.
		 To learn more, visit Java Access Specifier.
		static - If we use the static keyword, it can be accessed without creating objects.
		For example, the sqrt() method of standard Math class is static.
		 Hence, we can directly call Math.sqrt() without creating an instance of Math class.
		parameter1/parameter2 - These are values passed to a method. We can pass any number of arguments to a method.
