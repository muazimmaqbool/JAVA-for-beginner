//Java Anonymous Class : A nested class that doesn't have any name is known as an anonymous class.
//In Java, a class can contain another class known as nested class. 
//It's possible to create a nested class without giving any name.
/*An anonymous class must be defined inside another class. Hence,
 it is also known as an anonymous inner class. Its syntax is:
class outerClass {
    // defining anonymous class
    object1 = new Type(parameterList) {
         // body of the anonymous class
    };
}*/
//Anonymous classes usually extend subclasses or implement interfaces.
/*Here, Type can be
a superclass that an anonymous class extends
an interface that an anonymous class implements*/

/*The above code creates an object, object1, of an anonymous class at runtime.
   Note: Anonymous classes are defined inside an expression. So,
         the semicolon is used at the end of anonymous classes to indicate the end of the expression.*/
